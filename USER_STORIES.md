# User Stories: Intelligent Matching & Pitching

## For the Creative Talent
- **As a Creative,** I want to upload my PDF portfolio and have the AI identify my skills automatically, so I don't have to fill out long forms.
- **As a Freelancer,** I want the AI to write a tailored "Why me" section for a specific job application, so I can apply to more jobs with higher quality.
- **As a Designer,** I want to see a "Match Score" for every job posting, so I don't waste time applying for roles that don't fit my style.

## For the Employer
- **As a Creative Director,** I want to search for talent using descriptive terms like "moody, cinematic lighting," so I can find artists that fit a specific brand aesthetic.
- **As a Recruiter,** I want the system to rank applicants based on their actual portfolio content rather than just their resume keywords.
- **As a Small Business Owner,** I want the AI to help me write a job brief that attracts high-quality candidates because I don't know the technical jargon.

## For the Platform Admin
- **As an Admin,** I want to monitor the accuracy of the AI Pitch Engine, so I can fine-tune the prompts and models.
